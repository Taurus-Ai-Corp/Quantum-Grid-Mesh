## Market Gap Analysis

### Competitors (as of early 2025)

| Product | Type | Pricing | PQC Attestations | Blockchain Audit | EU AI Act |
|---------|------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| NeMo Guardrails (NVIDIA) | OSS + enterprise | Free / custom | No | No | Partial |
| Guardrails AI | OSS + cloud | Free / custom | No | No | No |
| Llama Guard (Meta) | OSS model | Free | No | No | No |
| CalypsoAI | SaaS platform | $50K-200K/yr | No | No | Yes |
| Holistic AI | Assessment platform | $30K-100K/yr | No | No | Yes |
| Fairly AI | Governance platform | Custom | No | No | Yes |
| Vanta/Drata | GRC platform | $20K-80K/yr | No | No | Indirect |

### The Gap NOBODY Fills

1. **PQC-signed AI attestations** — ML-DSA-65 is a NIST PQC standard (FIPS 204). ZERO commercial products offer quantum-safe signed proof that an AI decision was made with specific guard rules. This is a $0 → $1 market creation.

2. **Blockchain audit trail** — Hedera HCS provides immutable, governed, carbon-negative anchoring. No AI governance tool uses it. Regulators love immutable audit trails.

3. **Jurisdiction-aware guard rules** — Current tools are country-agnostic. GRIDERA|Guard maps guard rules to specific EU AI Act articles, NIST AI RMF categories, and SOC 2 controls.

4. **$1K/mo entry point** — CalypsoAI starts at $50K/yr. Holistic AI at $30K. We start at $1K/mo for SMB. 50x price disruption.

### Our Moat

- ML-DSA-65 signing (NIST PQC standard, FIPS 204) — nobody else has this
- Hedera HCS anchoring — immutable, governed, ESG-friendly
- EU AI Act Article 9/11/14/15 compliance mapping — regulatory-ready
- TypeScript SDK — integrates in 5 minutes, any framework
- $1K/mo starting price — 50x cheaper than enterprise incumbents

## Product Architecture

### Extraction from Comply → Standalone Package

The current `ai-guard.ts` (290 LOC) + `ai-guard-rules.ts` (172 LOC) = 462 LOC of production code.
Extraction plan:

```
@taurus/guard (npm package)
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              ← Public API: execute(), checkInput(), checkOutput()
│   ├── guard.ts              ← Core execute() logic (from ai-guard.ts)
│   ├── rules.ts              ← Guard rules engine (from ai-guard-rules.ts)
│   ├── attestation.ts        ← PQC signing (extracted from guard.ts)
│   ├── audit.ts              ← Audit trail persistence (extracted from guard.ts)
│   ├── hedera.ts             ← HCS anchoring (new, from @taurus/hedera)
│   ├── pricing.ts            ← Model pricing calculator (extracted)
│   ├── types.ts              ← GuardInput, GuardAttestation, GuardResult, etc.
│   └── presets/
│       ├── eu-ai-act.ts      ← EU AI Act Article 9/11/14/15 rule presets
│       ├── nist-ai-rmf.ts    ← NIST AI Risk Management Framework presets
│       └── soc2.ts            ← SOC 2 Type II control mapping presets
├── test/
│   ├── guard.test.ts
│   ├── rules.test.ts
│   ├── attestation.test.ts
│   ├── hedera.test.ts
│   └── integration.test.ts
└── package.json
```

### API Endpoints (5 routes, Fastify)

```
POST /guard/v1/execute      ← Main guard endpoint (wrap LLM call)
POST /guard/v1/check-input  ← Input-only validation
POST /guard/v1/check-output ← Output-only validation
GET  /guard/v1/attestations/:id ← Retrieve signed attestation
POST /guard/v1/anchor       ← Anchor attestation to Hedera HCS
```

### SDK Usage (5-minute integration)

```typescript
import { createGuard } from '@taurus/guard'

const guard = createGuard({
  jurisdiction: 'eu',
  preset: 'eu-ai-act',
  pqcKey: process.env.PLATFORM_PQC_SECRET_KEY,
  hederaConfig: { network: 'mainnet', topicId: process.env.HEDERA_TOPIC_ID }
})

const result = await guard.execute({
  prompt: userPrompt,
  llmCall: () => model.generate(userPrompt),
  model: 'gpt-4',
  jurisdiction: 'eu'
})

// result.blocked? → guard blocked the call
// result.attestation → ML-DSA-65 signed proof
// result.attestation.signature → verifiable PQC signature
// result.attestation.guard_verdict → 'pass' | 'block' | 'warn'
```

### Revenue Assumptions
- UAE fintech pilots close in 6-8 weeks (ATRC/QuantumGate warm intros)
- ADGM RegLab alumni are warm leads (980 regulated entities)
- Guard+Comply bundle increases deal size 3x
- Canada SR&ED tax credit on PQC R&D (~35% recovery)
- Enterprise deals start at $3K/mo, expand to $5-12K/mo with Observe+Comply bundle

## Go-to-Market Channels

1. **UAE fintech corridor** — ATRC/QuantumGate partnership, ADGM RegLab, DFSA regulated entities
2. **EU AI Act compliance** — Companies scrambling for Articles 9/11/14/15 proof before enforcement
3. **SOC 2 Type II** — AI governance is a new SOC 2 control area; Guard provides audit evidence
4. **Developer community** — Open-source the SDK, monetize the attestation/HCS anchoring API
5. **Hedera ecosystem** — HBAR Foundation grants, Hashgraph community, enterprise Hedera users

## Key Decisions

- **Not forking NeMo Guardrails** — wrong domain (LLM steering ≠ PQC compliance), Python-only, NVIDIA-branded
- **TypeScript SDK** — our target market (fintech, compliance teams) writes TypeScript
- **Rule-based, not ML** — auditable, deterministic, no black-box trust issues
- **PQC signing first, Hedera anchoring second** — PQC is the unique moat, Hedera is the differentiator
- **$1K/mo starting price** — 50x cheaper than incumbents, volume play
- **Open-core model** — SDK is OSS, attestation API + HCS anchoring is paid
